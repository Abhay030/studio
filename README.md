## üìÑ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v20 or later)
-   `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/engage-ai.git
    cd engage-ai
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Google AI API key.
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
    ```
    You can obtain an API key from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

4.  **Run the development server:**
    The application runs on two separate processes: the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI flows.

    -   **Start the Next.js app:**
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        This will start the frontend on [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).

    -   **Start the Genkit development server:**
        In a separate terminal, run:
        ```bash
        npm run genkit:dev
        ```
        This starts the Genkit developer UI on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) and makes the AI flows available to the frontend.

## üí° How to Use

1.  Navigate to the deployed app or your local instance ([http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002)).
2.  Drag and drop a file into the upload area, or click "Or browse files" to select a document from your computer.
3.  The application will automatically extract the text and analyze it.
4.  Once the analysis is complete, you will see your original content on the left and the AI-generated suggestions for clarity, sentiment, and call to action on the right.
5.  Click "Analyze Another Document" to start over.
